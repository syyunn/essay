### **Joy Is the Emotional Shape of Adaptation**

I’ve come to see the mind as a token‑generator. Thought after thought streams out—so why not train it to keep minting tokens of joy? When your “default output” is delight, life becomes a steady flow of self‑renewing energy.

Running is where I feel it most. In those perfect strides—lungs open, muscles synchronized—I’m literally shaping joy in real time. The feeling isn’t just pleasant; it’s a signal that my body and mind are adapting to exactly what I love.

Language works the same way. The moment I start writing in English, my brain slips into an English‑speaker’s groove. That tiny jolt of satisfaction propels further adaptation. Joy, in other words, is the emotional form—the very *shape*—of change. Stack enough genuine bursts of happiness and your whole system bends toward the things that spark them.

This is why following someone else’s “10 steps to success” often falls flat. Advice is useful, but without your own reservoir of high‑quality joy, the results feel hollow. People hit their goals and still wonder, *Was this what I wanted?* The emptiness comes from mistaking external milestones for the internal fuel that powers real growth.

So measure progress by the joy you accumulate. Treat each authentic, visceral moment—those you recognize instantly, the way you’d recognize an epiphany—as a unit of adaptive capital. Fill your ledger with them. When joy is your primary currency, transformation happens naturally, and regret has nowhere to spend the night.
